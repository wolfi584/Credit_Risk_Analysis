# Credit Risk Analysis Challenge

## Overview
For this challenge I am applying different Artificial Intelligence methods of supervised learning to predict credit card risk. Oversampling, undersampling, SMOTE, clustercentroids, SMOTEEN are some algorithims I am using in this exercise. Balancedrandomforestclassifier and easyensembleclassifier will also be used to predict risk. Once the analysis is complete I am assesing the applied prediction methods - how accurate are they? Can they safely be used to make predictions for fraud? Let's find out!
